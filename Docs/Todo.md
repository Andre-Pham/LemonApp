# Lemon Todo

* Try out continuous compiling, so instead of compiling, say, 10 predictions then compiling then removing all the predictions, constantly keep the last 10 predictions and constantly have new results ready based of the last 10 predictions
* Refactor overlay views to be in an array with a protocol `OverlayView`, also clean them up in general
* Add a mega toggle which toggles everything on the screen (like a FAB)
