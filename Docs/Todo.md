# Lemon Todo

* Get some training data
* Develop an algorithm to find then render a polygon onto the user's screen based on colours
* Write "Audio Issue Documentation" where I go case by case and explain the technical details of what the problem is and the upsides and downsides
* Attempt to implement voice control
* Retrain model:
    * Increase batch size
    * Reduce grid size (so object next to each other are still detected)
    * Increased iterations?
    * Wider dataset to account for limitations
