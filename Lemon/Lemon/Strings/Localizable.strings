"description.head" = "The head of an insect is where the main receptor parts are located. Typically, you will find the eyes, mouthparts constituting the mouth and biting parts (which also serve to guide food into the mouth), and a pair of antennae, which are sensory organs that allow the insect to use it's smell, taste, touch and 'hearing' abilities. The head of the insect is the most powerful part of it's body and is built from several connecting plates.\nThe eyes of an insect are known as 'compound eyes' meaning that they are made up of several smaller eyes functioning in unison.";

"description.thorax" = "The thorax, or mid-section, typically holds the wings (if the insect can fly), usually two pairs (for a total of 4 wings) and 3 sets of legs (for a total of 6 legs). The thorax is also the central location of the more powerful muscles used in operating the wings and legs of the insect.\nThe wings of most insects are setup with a support structure of thickened veins. The pattern of these veins varies from insect to insect. The feet-tips of insects will usually contain sticky pads, hooks or suckers of some type which allow the inset to cling to various types of surfaces or to clasp on to it's prey.";

"description.wings" = "The wings have no description.";

"description.abdomen" = "The abdomen makes up the last, and probably the most recognizable, part of the insect. This section of the body stores the bug's digestive system, reproductive organs and sting organs (if applicable). The abdomen is a reactive part of the insect body, meaning that it can expand when the insect feeds.";
